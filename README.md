# Fun With JS Events

I wanted to make some practice with events. This will be a small collection of thingies that make use of various events.

As of right now I only have one demo. I intend to add some more.

## Built with

- Pure vanilla JavaScript
- A little HTML
- A little CSS

## Demo 1

Demo 1 makes use of click events. This is a simple game where a button will randomly spawn around the screen and the user gains a point for successfully clicking it. Secondary goal is to get the highest combo possible which increases with each subsequent click. This is reset when the button's timer runs out and moves before being clicked.

## Known Issues

- Demo 1: currently the combo counter resets after every button move. I know why but I need to stop for tonight.
